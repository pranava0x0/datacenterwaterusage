# Clean Water Act enforcement & a data-center read-across

> **Research reference for the Data Center Water Use Tracker.** The Clean Water Act (CWA,
> 33 U.S.C. §1251 et seq.) is the federal statute governing pollutant discharges to U.S. waters —
> directly relevant to data-center **cooling-water discharge, stormwater, wetlands fill, and on-site
> fuel storage**. This note catalogs how the CWA has actually been *enforced* (energy/utility sector,
> **2015 → present**) and maps each statutory hook to data-center facts. It complements the project's
> VA/OH portal scraping (which captures *water-use* documents) with the *federal enforcement* angle.
> Web-sourced from primary `.gov` (EPA, DOJ) + the Congressional Research Service. Captured 2026-06-02.
> **Data-center application is forward-looking analysis — no data-center CWA enforcement case exists yet.**

## Why this exists

Compiled while scoping the regulatory exposure around data-center water use. There are (as of mid-2026)
**no CWA enforcement actions against a data center** — so to understand the likely shape of future
enforcement, this catalogs the energy/utility CWA cases that *have* been brought and reads their
statutory hooks across to data-center operations. The case facts below are quoted from primary EPA/DOJ
sources; the data-center column is analysis, labeled as such.

## Enforcement actions — energy/utility, 2015–present

Type: **C** = criminal · **Civ** = civil judicial · **Adm** = administrative.

**Landmark / jurisdiction:** *Sackett v. EPA* (decided May 25, 2023) narrowed CWA "waters of the
United States" to relatively permanent waters + the "continuous surface connection" wetlands test,
rejecting the *Rapanos* "significant nexus" standard; EPA/Army amended the 2023 WOTUS rule to
conform. [CRS LSB10981](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10981)

## Civil/administrative coverage — the long tail

Criminal CWA prosecutions in this sector are **near-comprehensive** above. Civil/administrative is
**representative, not exhaustive**: EPA's ECHO database returned **~1,626 CWA case rows** in a single
slice — the bulk are small facility-level administrative penalties that don't generate national press
releases and aren't individually notable. The authoritative places to go exhaustive:

- **EPA Civil Cases and Settlements** (notable federal tier, filterable by statute): <https://cfpub.epa.gov/enforcement/cases/>
- **EPA ECHO** (every facility-level action, filterable by statute + NAICS, bulk export): <https://echo.epa.gov/>
- **DOJ ENRD** press releases / cases: <https://www.justice.gov/enrd>

When the project starts tracking data-center facilities directly, ECHO can be filtered by the facility's
own NAICS (**518210** data processing/hosting) and by the **551114 / 221** codes of any co-located
generation, to catch a data-center NPDES or §311 action the moment one is brought.

### Leads surfaced but NOT yet confirmed against a primary source
- **Energy Transfer** — reportedly ~$7M federal CWA penalty for three Louisiana releases (+ ~$1M LA state, Caddo Parish). Couldn't locate the primary `.gov` page.
- **ATP Infrastructure Partners, LP** — ~$1M CWA settlement (Gulf offshore oil/gas). Date unverified.
- **Trans Energy Inc.** — ~$3M, WV §404 stream/wetland fill at gas well sites (~2015). Date/amount unverified.
- **Xplor Energy** — felony CWA, U.S. v. (E.D. La.). Date unverified.

### Verified pre-2015 → excluded
**XTO Energy** ($100K, §301 fracking flowback, PA, **2013**) · **Patriot Coal** ($6.5M, WV, **2009**) ·
**Colonial Pipeline** ($34M, **2003**) · **Pacific Pipeline Systems** ($1.3M, **2010**) ·
**Transocean** ($1.4B Deepwater Horizon plea, **2013**) · **Anadarko** 2009 CWA settlement (>$1M; distinct from the 2015 DWH $159.5M penalty) ·
**Louisiana Generating** ($3.5M — Clean *Air* Act, wrong statute, 2009) · **Koch** refinery/oil-spill CWA (pre-2015).

## The CWA hooks, and how they map to data centers

Because **no data-center CWA case exists yet**, the data-center column is a forward-looking read-across
from the statutory hooks the energy cases turned on — analysis, not enforcement.

| CWA provision (U.S. Code) | What it prohibits / requires | Cases above | Data-center read-across (analytical) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **§301(a)** (33 U.S.C. §1311) | Master rule: no discharge of any pollutant from a point source except per permit | underlies every civil case | Any data-center point-source discharge to a water of the U.S. needs authorization |
| **§402 — NPDES** (33 U.S.C. §1342) | Permit; numeric effluent limits; includes industrial + construction **stormwater** | West Penn (boron), Arch (mine metals), coal-ash impoundments | **Cooling-water blowdown** (biocides, heat) and **construction/industrial stormwater** are the likeliest triggers |
| **§311** (33 U.S.C. §1321) | Oil/hazardous-substance **spill** liability; per-barrel penalties; gross-negligence multiplier; **SPCC** plans (§311(j)); duty to report | BP, Anadarko, ExxonMobil, Holly/Osage, Summit, Amplify, Enbridge, Sunoco, Magellan, SFPP, Plantation | **On-site diesel generator fuel farms & deliveries** — a fuel release reaching a creek is the *same* violation as the pipeline cases; SPCC already attaches to large fuel storage |
| **§309(c)** (33 U.S.C. §1319) | Criminal: (c)(1) negligent, (c)(2) knowing, (c)(4) false statements | Duke, Summit, Amplify (negligent pleas) | Criminal exposure needs no intent — **negligent operation/maintenance** of fuel or cooling systems suffices |
| **§404** (33 U.S.C. §1344) | Army Corps permit to dredge/fill wetlands & waters | jurisdictional backdrop (*Sackett*) | **Greenfield site grading** near wetlands — the classic large-construction CWA risk |
| **§401** (33 U.S.C. §1341) | State water-quality certification of federally permitted activity | jurisdictional backdrop | A state veto/condition point on §404 or NPDES authorizations for new builds |
| **§502(6)/§316** | Heat is a regulated "pollutant"; §316(b) cooling-water intake structures | power-plant thermal context (Duke) | Water-cooled hyperscale builds — and **co-located/behind-the-meter generation** — pull thermal-discharge & intake obligations |
| **§502(7) "waters of the U.S."** | Defines federal jurisdictional reach | *Sackett* (2023) narrowed it | Determines whether a given on-site wetland/stream is **federally** regulated at all |

### Recurring fact patterns that triggered enforcement
1. **Spills from stored/transported petroleum** (the dominant pattern). The violation is the *discharge event*.
2. **Exceeding numeric NPDES limits** in routine operational discharges (West Penn boron; Arch mine metals).
3. **Failure to maintain equipment / negligent operation** — elevated to *criminal* in Duke and Summit.
4. **Failure to report a spill promptly** — a separate criminal count (Summit).
5. **Gross negligence** as a penalty multiplier — the mechanism behind BP's record $5.5B.
6. **Construction/stormwater & sediment** during large land disturbance (the mining-site analog in Arch).

### Data-center exposure map
- **Cooling/process water (the §402 NPDES analog) — most relevant to this project.** Evaporative-cooling
  **blowdown** carries biocides, anti-scalants, and **heat** (a regulated pollutant); discharging to
  surface water (or some POTWs) implicates NPDES numeric limits — the *West Penn* pattern. This is the
  direct overlap with the water-use metrics the tracker scrapes.
- **Construction phase (highest near-term risk).** Hyperscale campuses disturb hundreds of acres;
  sediment-laden stormwater is the most-enforced CWA violation against large construction →
  **§402 Construction General Permit** + **§404/§401** if wetlands/streams are touched. (The *Arch* analog.)
- **Backup power & fuel storage (the §311 analog).** Large diesel generator fleets + on-site fuel farms =
  SPCC-regulated oil storage; a release reaching a water of the U.S. is legally identical to the pipeline
  cases — including negligence-criminal exposure, the gross-negligence multiplier, and the duty-to-report trap.
- **Co-located / behind-the-meter generation.** On-site gas turbines / fuel cells / co-located plants carry
  the **full** power-plant CWA profile — §316(b) intake, thermal discharge, combustion-residual wastewater
  (the *Duke* profile).

### The *Sackett* wrinkle
*Sackett* (2023) **shrank federal jurisdiction**, so some on-site wetlands/ephemeral streams a data
center fills may no longer require a federal §404 permit. But (1) **§402 (stormwater/discharge) and §311
(spills) don't depend on the wetland question** — they bite regardless; and (2) **many states retained
broader-than-federal water programs** (relevant for the project's VA/OH focus — both run their own
programs), so a "no federal jurisdiction" wetland can still be fully state-regulated. Net: *Sackett*
narrows the §404/§401 wetlands path, not the operational-discharge or spill paths that drove most cases.
